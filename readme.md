## Minesweeper Daily
This is a pure web-based Minesweeper game inspired by the Wordle concept. The code was mostly generated by GPT-4, with minor modifications made to ensure the game is playable. Like Wordle, this game generates a unique puzzle every day.

Minesweeper Daily is a classic Minesweeper game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a grid of cells, some of which contain hidden mines. The goal of the game is to reveal all cells without mines while flagging cells that contain mines.

## Features
Pure web-based game, no external libraries or dependencies
Daily unique puzzles based on the current date
Mobile-friendly interface with hover buttons for flagging and revealing cells
Timer to track how long it takes to complete the puzzle

## How to Play
Clone or download this repository.
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.
Start playing by clicking on a cell to reveal it. If the cell contains a mine, you lose.
Flag cells that you believe contain mines by right-clicking or using the hover buttons on mobile devices.
Reveal all cells without mines to win the game.

## Tips
The number displayed on a revealed cell indicates the number of mines adjacent to that cell.
If you're confident that you've flagged all mines surrounding a numbered cell, you can reveal the remaining adjacent cells by clicking the middle mouse button or using the hover button on mobile devices.
The timer starts when you click on the first cell and continues until the game is over or restarted.
